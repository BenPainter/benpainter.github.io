      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The main goal of this website would be to show others, like potential buyers or employers, the projects and games that I have already made, and those that I am currently working on. Each page would show off a different game or idea and explain to the reader what unique story, gameplay or art that they should be expecting.  It would be a very efficient way to show off the different ideas and projects I have. 
    </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience for my audience is for a few different groups. The first is for people who have played some of my games and want to learn more about them. They will also be able to see other games that I have made and they might want to check them out as well. Another group of people is for future employers. They will be able to see the different projects that I have worked on. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The main reasons why people are visiting the home page is because they are either interested in seeing what I have done so far, or they are using it to access the other pages for more details about specific games or future plans. The main page will be giving the visitors an overarching view of what this website is all about. It will give them a simple summary of the different games that I have made and where to find them. There will also be a section that goes over a basic layout of my future projects. If the viewer were wanting to learn more about any specific game or future plans, they will be able to go to a different page that will give them more information. However, for this assignment, I will just be making it simple by only including one game and then future plans. Similar to how the White water rafting site uses images as links to different pages, the way to get to the different games and future plans will have their own image from the game that you can click on and it will take you to the page.

      <h3>Future and Me</h3>
      <p>
        The main goal for this page is to give the visitor more details about me and other future games that are either being created or just in a basic planning phase. For the about me section, I will keep it relatively short. I will provide a short background of where I was from and how I got into gaming and game making. I will also provide several different links that will lead them to different accounts like LinkedIn and a YouTube channel that will be hosting my game trailers. I might actually break this into two pages, but I feel like the About Me page would be too short so I’m adding it to the Future plans page.The Future Plan section will take up most of the page. It will be broken down into different sections for each game or concept that I have. The ideas that are more likely to come out or are currently being worked on in the background will be on the top of the page. As you go down further on the page, each idea will have less and less to it. For ideas that are higher up, additional information like possible release date and how that game might be fitting in the game universe will be given.

      <h3>Game 1</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently split between which game to be shown here. I have one game that is actually “done”, but it’s a super simple game with nothing really to it. But I have this other game that only really has some sprites ready for it and a bit of story. I think I will go with the latter of the two. But either way, this page will provide a background to the game. It will be broken up into three sections; the story, the gameplay, and art. The story will give the background of what is going on with the game as well as the first bit of story within the game. It will not give away too much information for the story. The trailer of the game might be added to this section as well. The gameplay section will describe what type of game it is. For example, if I choose the first game, I would mention that it is an endless arcade like game. If I choose the second game, I would describe it as a top down action adventure game. This section will also provide tips to help the player. The 3rd section is the art. This would be a simple section that showcases different sprites of the game and different themes of the game.
